# Prologue

This website shows you the R demo code for my dissertation: Bayesian solutions to high-dimensional data challenges using hybrid search. 

- [Chapter 3](#chapter3): Bayesian best subset selection by hybrid search under multivariate regression model of high dimensional data
- [Chapter 4](#chapter4): A general Bayesian variable selection method of high dimensional data via hybrid search for different distributions of response variable
